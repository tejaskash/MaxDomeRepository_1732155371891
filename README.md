## Welcome to your SageMaker Unified Studio Project

SageMaker Unified Studio provides an integrated experience for working on data engineering and integration, data preparation, lakehouses, data science, and generative AI initiatives.

A SageMaker Unified Studio project surfaces the data, tools, and compute needed for a data problem. You can import data from your business data catalog or Amazon Redshift, or from other connectors such as Google BigQuery, Snowflake, and Microsoft SQL. Tooling includes components such as notebooks, queries, visual ETL, and generative AI playgrounds. With execution abstracted through managed connections that are either serverless or pre-configured by your administrator, you can concentrate on your code and data.

### Project overview

This page provides you with a single view into your business initiatives and consolidates required components at one central location. You get a single pane view of all your code, data, and compute for the project and your teams can work with notebooks, queries, dashboards, and other project resources in the same environment. This abstracts the interfaces and infrastructure (compute, governance, query tools, APIs, and more) of a multi-service, multi-compute environment away from your teams.

Use Amazon Q, available at any time from the top right of SageMaker Unified Studio toolbar, to generate code, tests, and debugs, and implement generated code with multi-step planning and reasoning capabilities.

### Data

The **Data** tab shows all data with which you can operate.

### Compute

The **Compute** tab displays the configured clusters (for Spark), databases (such as Amazon Redshift), Spaces (IDEs like JupyterLab), HyperPods, and ML tracking servers, along with other execution endpoints configured for the project. From any of its tabs, you can add additional compute connections to your project as permitted by your administrators. 

### Members

The **Members** tab provides a view of the users and groups you've invited to collaborate on your project, along with their respective roles.

## Discover, Build and Manage

At the top of your screen are three menus: **Discover**, **Build**, and **Manage**.

### Discover

On the **Discover** menu, you have access to the business catalog and its related resources, as well as generative AI playgrounds, catalogs, and shared assets.

### Build

The **Build** menu provides tools for data analysis and tools for data analysis and engineering, including our poly-compute JupyterLab Notebooks, a multi-engine SQL editor, AI-powered Visual ETL, and Airflow-based workflow tools. With the **Machine Learning** secondary menu, you can take that cleansed data and apply it to classical machine learning from experimentation to hosting inference endpoints. With the generative AI features, you can customize and build apps with Bedrock's Generative AI tooling suite. All of our tools are enhanced by Amazon Q for improving productivity and empowering users to focus on their goals. 

### Manage

On the **Manage** menu, administrators can manage the SageMaker Unified Studio domains, account associations, and end-user permissions.

We hope you enjoy using SageMaker Unified Studio and we look forward to hearing from you. Please use the **Feedback** icon in the top right corner of your screen to provide feedback.

## Sample Notebook

The getting_started.ipynb notebook covers the basics of using SageMaker Unified Studio connections with Python kernel for Spark and BigData use, and is intended as an introduction to the notebook functionality for those not familiar with SageMaker Unified Studio connections.
